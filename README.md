## Providers

We hope to simultaneously upload our cloud images to a variety of internal and
external spaces. Currently, the code supports Amazon EC2. Work has begun
toward supporting Rackspace, GCE, and HP. We're currently waiting on some
legal developments to determine what sort of account and access we'll have
to these providers.
